<b>It's the start of March, and it's getting warmer every day. A quarter of the year is almost ended, but for Vietnamese, it's still the first month of the Lunar New Year. For us, the start of Lunar New Year is the most important day of the year (which is our "Tet holiday"), and we celebrate it with a lot of activities. One of them is to write the first piece of the year, which is marked as the "Pen-opening" piece.</b>

In the past, the Vietnamese wear traditional "Áo dài" all the time, and the teachers usually wear black ones, which became their trademarked clothes. Nowadays we only wear traditional Ao Dai on a special occasion, and New Year is one of them. It's a nice tradition in the past for people to ask the teachers who are good at writing to write them a piece as a good luck charm.
Now we use the alphabets instead of Chinese Kanji and Vietnamese old "Nôm" letters (a variant of Kanji), but many people still keep their interest in Kanji, and having a Kanji piece in Lunar New Year is still considered as having a good luck charm.
<br><br>
For the "Pen-opening" piece, it can be anything. A poem, a letter, or for children it's good to have them solve a Math problem as the "Pen-opening" piece. Vietnamese believe that the "Pen-opening" piece will give the luck based on the content of the piece, so by solving a Math problem, parents wish that their children will be hard-working this year, and became good at the subject. 
But on top of everything, a Kanji piece always gives the most "Tet feeling".
<br><br>
Since my childhood, I always love the Kanji pieces a lot. Black ink on red paper, it feels festive, and it reminds me of the Tet holidays when I was young, and my parents take me to the street vendors to get a Kanji piece. So this year, because of the Covid situation, I can't go home on the Tet holiday, so we decided to write our own Kanji piece as a "Pen-opening" piece.

I bought a pen set on Amazon, then realize there are cheaper pens in the 100 yen shop Σ（￣□￣；）. So it's possible to get everything I needed from the 100 yen shop for contributing a Kanji piece: pen, papers, and ink. But each pen is 100 yen, so maybe a set of different size pens on Amazon might be cheaper (but I only needed 2 out of 6 pens that I bought TTvTT). 
<br>
Anyway, it was exciting to wake up on the first day of the year, and setting up for a caligraphy show.

It's not easy to write beautiful Kanji characters, but I will work on it and I believe I'll get better over time. Hopefully, that when the Covid situation got better, I can write better pieces to gift my parents. They will think it's ugly (for sure haha), but they'll be happy to receive it.
<br><br>
The second Covid year started, and the first one was not an easy one for all of us. Let's all be strong, continue to follow social-distancing rules, and hope for the better! I wish you a safe and happy lunar new year, and I hope that we can all reunite with our loved ones soon after all of this is over.
<br><br>
Be strong today, be happier tomorrow.
