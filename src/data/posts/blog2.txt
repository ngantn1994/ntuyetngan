<b>Vietnam street food is famous for its cheap price and delicious taste. Usually, we grab a meal at a street vendor for breakfast, and one of my favorites is "Xôi xéo" - sticky rice with cooked green bean, shredded fish-sauce flavored meat, and crispy fried purple onion. It's delicious, and a portion of 5000 dongs (which is about 25 yen) is enough because eating sticky rice will make you full for a long time.</b>

When I was younger, just until recently before I had my business trips abroad, foreign recipes are always more delicious, harder to have (because they are not common), and feel "luxury". It's funny, because for a long time Vietnamese people considered fast food (like KFC) as luxury meals because they are more expensive than local meals and they are cooked in a way that Vietnamese was not used to. It's not the same now because the deep-fried cook became more and more common, and people have a higher standard of living now that a "healthy meal" is more preferable, and fast food became a lot cheaper compare to local luxury meals. (One factor might be Vietnamese people love "buffet", and a hotpot-grilled buffet combo is not that expensive, about 1000 yen ~ 2000 yen for each person, so it's the current trend for parties right now. Funny thing is, most of those buffet restaurants advertise themselves as "foreign buffet restaurants", when in fact, they are not).
<br><br>
And then, I have my business trips to Singapore, then Japan, and now came to Japan to live, I realized how good and hard to cook Vietnamese food was. Maybe because I'm not a local, so I don't have the ability to tell which restaurant is better than the others, and I can't tell the differences between the dishes I cooked myself (used the spices I bought from the supermarket) and the dish I ate at the restaurant. So local Japanese dishes became normal now, while Vietnamese food became a luxury. There are Vietnamese restaurants here and there too, but the taste is always wrong somehow, that's why when I want to eat something, I would do it myself.
<br><br>
I was not able to find purple onion here, so there are a lot of dishes that I won't be able to recreate. Until I came upon this baby, I was overjoyed because there are so many meals I'll be able to cook now.

To cook "Xoi xeo", first of all, I'll need to make "ruoc" (the shredded meat) first. I bought our Vietnamese fish sauce from Amazon and made a big bottle of it. It's not a hard dish, but the part to stir the shredded meat on a low-heat pan until it has a nice yellow cost me more than 1 hour. It's impossible to shorten the time because the bigger heat will burn the meat and it will lose its softness.

And that's when I realize why Vietnamese dishes are harder to cook here. Not only the ingredients finding part, but because Vietnamese people still prefer to do most of the cooking by themselves, instant recipes are hard to find even in Vietnam. Many of the dishes require long cook time on low heat with patience and non-stop stirring (traditional "mứt" - sugar dried fruit for example), and others require experiences over time to make it good enough.
<br>
And in "Xoi xeo"'s case, making the green bean's ball is the hardest part.

<br>
In street vendors, the shopkeeper lady will use a knife to cut the green bean ball in a really fast speed. The ball needs to be condensed enough to not be destructured completely and at the same time, soft enough to be delicious. I learned how to shape it in my mother's "bridal training lesson". Yeah, you heard it right. In Vietnam, traditional banh chung uses this ball as its core along with the meat, even though it'll be destructed during the wrapping time it needs to stay in its shape to maintain its quality and taste before that. A long time ago we don't have skinless green beans in stock, so the peeling part must be done by ourselves. And for my bridal training, my mom made me peeled of a whole bucket of green beans. (So later when my mother-in-law asked me to peel a small bowl of it, it was a piece of cake hahaha. Although later I realized that my mother-in-law did not want to test me, but she wanted to teach me how to do it. She was really kind to compare to my tiger mother).
<br><br>
The peeling part is hard, but it's easy to buy skinless green beans now, so it's not a problem. The real problem is the ball-forming part. My mom did this since she was young, so she made it looks easy to do. But the truth is, it's really hard to maintain the power of your hand to be able to push all the air outside of the ball when at the same time, not break it. I almost failed, but luckily, I remembered how mom always tells me to form the ball when the beans were still hot, so if I failed, I only need to put the beans in the pan and stir it again, then try again. It took me almost one hour for this small little dude.

It's funny to me now how I did not treasure the meals I have back home, and prefer foreign meals at the time being. It's bitter to realize how much thought mom put into every meal, and how patience must mom be to be able to create the "common" meals that I always had. But it warms my heart thinking about what I learned from her, and I'm proud that after all of those lessons (with a lot of scolding too haha), I can recreate her meals now, even if it's not perfect. I called my mother to tell her about it after that, and she gave me another of her long lesson ƪ(˘⌣˘)ʃ
<br><br>
Thanks to having the chance to go abroad, I realize the value of what I have at home. It's not necessary to consider "leaving" as denying or running away or something. But it's a part of "growing up". I'll continue to learn, hoping that I'll grow more and more every day, including learning how to treasure what I have.
<br><br>
I'll be making Xoi xeo again this weekend.
