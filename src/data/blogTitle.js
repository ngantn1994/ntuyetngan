      summary: 'Vietnam street food is famous for its cheap price and delicious taste. Usually, we grab a meal at a street vendor for breakfast, and one of my favorites is "Xôi xéo" - sticky rice with cooked green bean, shredded fish-sauce flavored meat, and crispy fried purple onion. It\'s delicious, and a portion of 5000 dongs (which is about 25 yen) is enough because eating sticky rice will make you full for a long time.',
